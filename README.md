# Project
## Santiago Salazar Ramirez
### Config:
* I used ChromeDriver.exe instead of the dependency option.
* Java 22.0.2 (Openjdk-22)
* You will notice that one test fails (Purchase product), that's because the exercise is asking us for a webpage that says "Thank you for your purchase", but the real output is "Thank you for your order".
